To run the local server, 

   Download and install python :
   	   http://www.python.org/getit/

   Download and install pip and Django :
   	   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/

Go to the root of the Test project 
   # cd PythonSimpleWebService/DjangoWebService

and run the project
   # ./manage.py runserver localhost:8080


If everything goes right, you should see:

You can try the server using :

    # curl http://localhost:8080/FlickrDjango/boston

Or, use the iOS sample app on my github, "MyFlickrTest"
